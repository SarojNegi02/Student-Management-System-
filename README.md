# Student-Management-System
Student Management System using Java, Spring Boot, React, MySQL

Student Management System is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the management of student information in educational institutions. The system allows administrators to register students, track attendance, and manage academic records efficiently.

The backend is built using Java and Spring Boot, providing secure and scalable RESTful APIs for handling business logic and database operations. MySQL is used for persistent data storage with optimized queries for fast retrieval. The frontend is developed using React, offering a responsive and interactive user interface that communicates seamlessly with the backend.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of full-stack development, REST API design, database integration, and frontend-backend communication.
